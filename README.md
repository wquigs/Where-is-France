# Where-is-France
An app that points you in the direction of France.

The map view screen is used for displaying the user's distance from France, along with the direction towards France. The user can interact with this view by tapping anywhere on the map view. That will cause the arrow to spin around and ultimately land in the direction of France.

The purpose of the records screen is to keep track of the user's closest distances to France. The distance in meters, as well as the date achieved are displayed. There is nothing to interact with on this screen. Only the top three distances are recorded, and only one distance is stored per day. The table intentionally always has three cells, even when there are less than three appropriate records. This was a purposeful design decision so the user can implicitly see that we keep their top three records, to encourage them to come back again in the future. 

The colors screen is used for changing the color of the arrow. The arrow can interact with this screen by clicking on one of the boxes corresponding to the color that they want the arrow to be. The arrow color change is stored persistently, so the color will stay the same even after the user closes the application.

We used Xcode version 13.2.1 to compile our project. To accurately get the user's location, iOS hardware is required for testing. The only thing our app requires is location tracking, which is present on pretty much all iOS devices. The app still functions correctly on the simulator, but the location isn't always completely accurate.

Our app does follow the M-V-C architectural pattern with the views, a model that is used by multiple files, and our ViewControllerMap.swift file. Our user interface does have input in the form of pressing on the map view to spin the arrow. In addition, the user can click on buttons to change
the color of the arrow in the colors screen. We also have output in the form of displaying the user's distance from France in the first view, and displaying the map view with the arrow pointing in the direction of France. Our screen with the table view also displays the user's records. We do have three separate views in the form of the map view screen, the color screen, and the records screen. For the container view controller, we used a tab bar controller. We also do have a ClosestToFranceTableViewController.swift file that controls the table view that displays all the records. For persistent local data storage, we used core data to store the user's preference for the arrow color. For the required frameworks that we've seen in class we used core data and core location. Core data is implemented in the app delegate, in the ColorChangerViewController.swift file, and in the ViewControllerMap.swift file. We used core location in the Model.swift file and in the ViewControllerMap.swift file. We also used MapKit in the ViewControllerMap.swift file to display the map view. For the framework that we haven't seen in class, we used SpriteKit. We implemented that framework in the ViewControllerMap.swift and ArrowSKScene.swift files.
